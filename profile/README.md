## Hi there 👋

we are a team of software and video game developers. We mainly focus on productivity tools for 3D computer graphics and the development/porting of titles for digital entertainment.

Most of our tools are currently closed source, such as [Real IES](https://www.real-ies.com), [Real HDR](https://www.real-hdr.com) or [Real PBR](https://www.real-pbr.com).

Our video games for PC, console or VR are also distributed as closed source. We are the developers of [qb](https://www.qb-game.com), [Abyssus](https://www.abyssus-vr.com), [Fade Out](https://www.virtual-reality-escape-room.com), [DREAMERS](https://www.dreamers-game.com), and [Drone Tinkerer](https://www.drone-tinkerer.com).

Among the various projects we operate under the registered trade marks [3D Architettura](https://www.3darchitettura.com) and [Render Academy](https://www.renderacademy.com)

PlaySys is a registered trademark since 2008
